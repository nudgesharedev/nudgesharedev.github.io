# 1. Gathering requirements

## Questionnaires

We gained initial insight into our users by publishing three **questionnaires**. This medium felt justified given our limited time frame and allowed us to quickly form a representative **simple random sample** of our study population.

Each survey took into account user feedback from previous iterations. This allowed us to ask *more incisive* questions and gather higher quality response data. One key insight from this stage was that users care deeply about data privacy regarding medical information.

## Interviews

We performed semi-structured interviews to gain deeper insight and **triangulate** survey responses.

They felt more appropriate than focus groups because we were interested in *individual* user experiences here. Since NudgeShare will relate voice patterns to COPD disease, we asked a junior doctor about symptoms and voice features which could be statistically significant.

We also interviewed pseudo-users from our cohort to ask in-depth about data data visualisations and data privacy.

### **Interview with a junior doctor at Imperial College London**

Q*: How does COPD affect features of speech?*

A: COPD in mild and serious cases, can radically increase breathlessness. And this causes speech to become generally less fluent. Breathlessness itself also causes fatigue, so COPD patient generally sound more tired - I imagine you could dissect specific features for detecting fatigue.

Q: *What features could be helpful in predicting COPD before the patient begins suffering?*

A: Since it usually arises due to smoking and air pollution, these would be key factors to take into account. In terms of speech, I think it would be possible to detect early warning signs such as shortness of breath.

Q: *Our app aims to encourage users to speak to health professionals. What’s one motivator you could suggest?*

A: I think the app should normalise regular check ups for people at risk, by giving them clear and sensible reasons to do so. It should explain exactly which symptoms they’re experiencing and justify why speaking to a clinician

*will*

benefit them.

### **Interview with a student pseudo-user**

Q*: Who is someone you would recommend NudgeShare to?*

A: My grandfather has diabetes and doesn’t find much time to go for walks or exercise in outdoor environments. Although my family can offer encouragement, we live over two hours apart. An app like NudgeShare would really help him to find a more local support network and take regular walks.

Q: What form of health data visualisation would be most helpful to him in your opinion?

A: I think the visualisations should emphasise achievements and positivity [...] I think 3D visualisations are particularly helpful because they appeal to our intuitions about measure and volume.

Q: *We found that our target audience values data privacy -- what would assure you that NudgeShare uses your data ethically?*

A: I think the app should be completely transparent about how data is stored, and the user should be able to access and delete this data at any time. It should also be immediately clear to users that *they decide* when to share their data.
