# 3. Sketches And Prototypes

## Introduction

In the user-centred design model, the second phase involves creating "mock" designs. The details of how things will be implemented are abstracted away so we can focus on the UI and UX.

### Sketching

Sketching is a helpful methods for creating mock designs. Note that these sketches need not be beautiful works of art — which is okay because we want to promote fluid ideation.

Key sketching concepts

- sketches don't need to be artistically beautiful
- sketching is intended to promote fast and fluid idea generation
- try to create at least a dozen variations of an idea
- use annotations rather than figures on the sketch to convey more detailed information
- after creating lots of ideas, you can start combining, eliminating and refining them
- refined ideas can then be used as a the "seed" for new sketches (this "design funnel" process is akin to a genetic algorithm)
- focus on user emotional states — e.g. if drawing a stick figure, try to convey how they're feeling.

### Storyboarding

Storyboarding involves sketching a sequence of events, usually demonstrating an interaction between users and your design. Small explanations of each frame can be included. Storyboards can also be constructed by using photos rather than sketches.

### Prototyping

Prototyping is the next stage in the user-centric design process following sketching and storyboarding.

A prototype is a minimal implementation of a product that emphasises certain aspects while deemphasising others. Crucially a prototype must be a *usable* entity. It must be possible for people to interact with the design. Prototypes may also be called "simulations" or "models." They are often made of paper and cardboard.

## Creating Sketches

We started sketching alternative solutions by hand and with *MockFlow*. Users said our initial sketches felt cluttered so we constrained each page to a *single* function. Visibility was incorporated into later sketches by placing subtle arrows on clickable widgets. We used arrows rather than storyboards to represent flow, as they allowed users to freely explore the app’s structure (almost like a prototype).

Colour of circle changes depending on score:

Tasks to help improve the users wellbeing (scrolled down). This is not necessarily how they'll be displayed — i.e. we could have a list of cards with titles, (possibly pictures) and a small description.

Similar design with more features filled in.

Icons changed to textless. Suggestion list incorporated into homepage. "Wellbeing" or "Your wellbeing" placed as header title rather than part of the home page. 

This design feels slightly cluttered in regards to spacing. I think it's important to have the wellbeing status and tips as central features. However, perhaps they could reside on different pages. Or perhaps the wellbeing status could be redesigned to fit the layout more naturally.

Another criticism is that this could easily overwhelm users. Having a long list of tasks could feel like a chore. I think if these recommendations were on a separate page, and shown in a larger card form, they would appear more friendly and inviting.

Simplified design. Wellbeing score is given as a percentage. Cards are shown below to nudge the user. However, again, this to some extent still almost feels like a student's homework system. We want to motivate users into having greater agency over their wellbeing — it shouldn't just be a system which tells them what to do "nagging them essentially."

Alternative design:

Here the nudges are replaced with achievements. This is bound to be a more positive experience for the user. NudgeShare will nudge the user via notifications — and the app can serve as a place to focus on their achievements — progress rather than failure. This page will hold the achievements from the current or perhaps past two weeks. We could offer a more permanent store of their achievements somewhere else maybe.

If a user's score is exceptionally low and they haven't made any progress in the last week, this section could perhaps have a button which would get the app to make recommendations. But by default, we want to be positive. 

Alternatively, we could just have two sections — one (the primary one) for achievements, and a second for suggestions.

Rough idea of what the visualisations page might contain.

## Creating Prototypes

Our first prototype was very minimal as our goal was simply to see how users felt about the app’s general organisation. While users thought the app was very usable, they also felt that it was an emotionally negative experience. Users specifically pointed to:

- the overemphasis of wellbeing scores -- we don’t want users to feel “defined by” their wellbeing score.
- a lack of interesting aesthetics. Beyond being usable, the app should feel **engaging** - our design was bland and monotone.

We subsequently created a heuristic evaluation which took into account this feedback.

Users found our second prototype substantially more engaging. We used vivid colours, larger icons and soft shapes to create a calm and friendly tone. We refined the flow to make primary features accessible within one tap. Lastly, we made each screen more distinct to increase memorability. Our screens are shown below:
